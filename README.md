Sometimes when you go slalom training, it seems like everything is against you. Days like this just happen, next time it
will be better (or every other time). For now, let's check out this
[Slalom Bingo](https://slalom-bingo-react-ts.vercel.app/) and see just how bad it was.

## Working version
https://slalom-bingo-react-ts.vercel.app/

## How to run locally

1. Clone or download this repository.


2. Check if you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your computer (I used here Node v18.16.0 and npm 9.5.1):

   `node -v`

   `npm -v`


3. If you don't have one, install **Node.js** and **npm** for your OS from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
   When you install Node.js, you automatically get npm installed.


4. Go to the project folder and install dependencies:

   `npm i`


6. Run the app :

   `npm run dev`

...and go to  http://localhost:5173/
